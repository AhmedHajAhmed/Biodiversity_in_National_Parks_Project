# Biodiversity in National Parks


In this project, I analyzed data for the National Park Service. I will be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

I will perform data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and answer them in a meaningful way.
